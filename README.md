# Developing iOS 12 Apps with Swift

It's a repo of the projects and examples described in the `CS193P` course at Stanford University.

🃏 Card Matching Game – iOS12 & Swift (Xcode 10)

📚 Lecture 1: Introduction to iOS12, Xcode 10, and Swift

An overview of the iOS ecosystem and course objectives is provided, followed by a demonstration of a simple card matching game concept using a board example.

The process of creating a new project in Xcode is explained step by step, including how to name the project and replicate the board setup in code.
The initial version of the "Card Matching" game is constructed using 4 buttons and 1 label, laying the foundation for the UI.
🧩 Lecture 2: MVC (Model - View - Controller)

This section introduces the MVC architectural pattern, supported by educational materials and visual aids.
A theoretical explanation is followed by practical implementation within the existing project.

Two new .swift files are added:

    One implements a class-based structure 👨‍🏫

    The other utilizes a struct-based approach 🧱

With these additions, fundamental matching logic is integrated into the "Card Matching" game.
